# Machile_Learning

This is a Machine Learning project. The porpose is to predict default payment from bank's users. 
The project missed Unnitest and component test but it work finely.
I think it would have been better to keep generale variables to make the project flexible. I'll work on that :)


Then how it works ?

Well you must submit yur dataset (at csv format) in the data file.
Then change the name of the file in main (I'll manage to make it useless then and make a path walker that find the files alone).
You are able to change the threshold for the ramdom forest classifier and then make it run, check the statistics of your model, 
and get the prediction in the directory result and on the "timestamp" repertory. The label of dataset to predict is "default",
I must make it flexible when I'll make the CLI.

A lot of improvement needs to be done, about configurations of variables, and make it more user-friendly, but anyway enjoy it.
